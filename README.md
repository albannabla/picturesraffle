# CHRISTMAS LUCKY DRAW... BY PICTURES

I have tried to do a lucky draw for a company Christmas dinner so that each person is called by name and also showing 
the employee's picture.
I have found similar things online, but none of them was doing what I needed: eliminate each name from the ticket list while names
are being picked. 
I had to substitute all sensitive info and pictures, for privacy reasons.

Features:
- draw pictures and names
- remove names from the list while they are being picked
- easy to customize

Quick Set-up:
- modify initialnames.js to include all participants to the Lucky Draw
- place in the images folder all pictures
- make sure all pictures are named exactly as the name specified in initialnames.js and are in .jpg format
- substitute background.jpg and start.jpg (optional)
